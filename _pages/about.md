**About Me**

I am a third-year doctoral student in clinical psychology at Yale University and a clinical psychology intern at the Transitions Clinic in New Haven, a primary care clinic based at the New Haven Primary Care Consortium that serves individuals recently released from prison and jail who are living with chronic health conditions. In this role, I provide evidence-based psychotherapy to formerly incarcerated adults navigating co-occurring medical and psychological challenges.


**Research Interests**

My research focuses on understanding how exposure to community violence influences mental health outcomes. I am especially interested in how structural interventions, such as improving access to resources and care, can buffer against the psychological toll of community violence exposure. My work aims to inform policies and practices that promote community safety, enhance individual and collective well-being, and reduce pathways into the legal system. My doctoral research has been supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s [Health Policy Research Scholars Program](https://healthpolicyresearch-scholars.org/) and the National Science Foundation’s [Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program).
